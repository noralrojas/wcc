<blockquote>
    <p>You look at science (or at least talk of it) as some sort of demoralising invention of man, something apart from real life, and which must be cautiously guarded and kept separate from everyday existence. <strong>But science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated.</strong> Science, for me, gives a partial explanation of life. In so far as it goes, it is based on fact, experience and experimentâ€¦ In my view, all that is necessary for faith is the belief that by doing our best we shall come nearer to success and that success in our aims (the improvement of the lot of mankind, present and future) is worth attaining.</p>
    <em>-Rosalind Franklin, writing to her father in 1940</em>

    <h2>Unsung Hero of Science</h2>
    <p>Rosalind Franklin was a British chemist and X-Ray chrystallographer whose work on DNA led to the discovery of the molecule's double helix structure. Though Franklin's colleague Maurice Wilkens went on to win the Nobel Prize along with James Watson and Francis Crick for the discovery of the DNA double helix, it was Franklin's expert X-ray diffraction images of the molecule that provided the basis for Watson and Crick's famed model. Franklin then went on to make critical discoveries about the molecular structures of RNA and viruses. Sadly, at the time of her premature death in 1958, her enormous contributions to science were largely unrecognized.</p>

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>At fifteen, Franklin knew she wanted to be a scientist. Though her father discouraged her, she pursued her dream anyway, earning a scholarship to study chemistry at Cambridge University.</li>
            <li>Some of her earliest work involved research for the British Coal Utilization Research Association on the structure of coal, which led to better gas masks for British soldiers during World War II.</li>
            <li>In 1951, Franklin was offered a research scholarship at King's college and assigned to work on the rapidly developing study of DNA because of her expertise in X-ray diffraction. Her new collegue, Maurice Wilkins, was away when she arrived and when he returned he assumed she was his new assistant.</li>
            <li>She left King's college for Birkbeck college, where she led a team that studied the structure of the Tobbaco Mosiac Virus and other RNA viruses affecting plants.</li>
